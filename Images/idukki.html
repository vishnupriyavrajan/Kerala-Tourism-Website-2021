Precisely, the dam is constructed in a gorge between two hills, Kuravathi and Kuravan. It is at the height of about 550 feet and is a breathtaking sight in the otherwise rugged terrain along which has been built.

The surrounding is lush green, and the reservoir serves as a quick getaway for locals. As part of promoting hydel tourism, boating in the reservoir is open for tourists.</p>
