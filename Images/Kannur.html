              <p class="card-text">The impeccably unspoiled Payyabalam beach is adorned with sparkling pearls of golden sand and foamy white waves of the Arabian Sea. The highlight of Kannur and one of the many beautiful beaches of Kerala, the Payyabalam beach has an incredibly peaceful and inviting aura. Unwind after a long week by relaxing at this remarkable seashore and find yourself mesmerized by its elegant beauty and contagious calm. The approach to the beach is through a small crossover bridge that is built over a narrow canal. To the right of the bridge are the memorials of Kannur's important political personalities that had passed away over the recent decades. </p>

              <p class="card-text">The Muzzhapilangad Drive-in Beach at Kannur is one referred to with many superlatives- as the longest drive-in beach in the whole of India, as one of the cleanest beaches of Kannur and most importantly, as one of the best drive-in beaches that the entire Asian continent has to offer!

                Being Kerala's only drive-in beach, it attracts the attention of many tourists around the year. The whole concept of drive-in beaches is that you can drive right on the sandy shores of the beach- it is not very often that you get to drive along a 4 km long shoreline that offers an open road with no traffic and a stunning view.</p>

              <p class="card-text">St Angelos Fort is definitely one of the most popular and frequently visited attractions of Kannur and for more reasons than one. The polished yet prehistoric structure of this fortress oozes with unadulterated elegance and overwhelming power. Standing ashore in the Arabian sea, St Angelos Fort enjoys a panoramic and unobstructed view of the diorama created by the merger of the magnetic waves and the azure waters. It also overlooks the mesmerising Mopilla Bay, a natural harbour.St Angelos Fort is mainly famous for the gripping history and the intriguing tales it has to tell. This fort was a point of interest for many dynasties of domestic as well as the international origin and has seen many bitter battles in the quest to conquer it. The Portuguese Viceroy, Dom Francisco de Almeida had imprisoned his successor, Alfonso de Albuquerque because he did not want to give up the reins of his power. This led to a series of bitter events and conspiracies that have been etched in the history of Portugal as well as Kannur forever.</p>
