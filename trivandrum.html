              <p class="card-text">The Padmanabhaswamy temple is a Hindu temple located in Thiruvananthapuram, the state capital of Kerala, India. It is considered as the richest place of worship in the world. The name of the city of 'Thiruvananthapuram' in Malayalam translates to "The City of Lord Ananta", referring to the deity of the Padmanabhaswamy temple. The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Chera style and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopura. While the Ananthapura temple at Kumbla in Kasaragod is considered as the original seat of the deity, architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar. </p>

              <p class="card-text">Built in the 1840s by the great Maharaja Swathi Thirunal, the Kuthira Malika Palace stands as an iconic monument that gives you a curious insight into the glorious history of Kerala. 'Kuthira Malika' literally translates to 'Mansion of horses', and it has been named so because of the 122 horses that adorn the many pillars that support the southern roof of this majestic structure. The main idea behind building this palace was to preserve and promote the many traditional art forms of India, mainly the south.</p>
