Rafts made of logs were taken downstream during the monsoon season to Kallai, where these were sawn to size in the timber mills dotting the banks of the river.The village of Kallayi is situated on the banks of the river Kallayi. It has an archaic charm and was a busy timber trade centre during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</p>
