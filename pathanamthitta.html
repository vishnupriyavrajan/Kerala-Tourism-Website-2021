              <p class="card-text">At a distance of 26 km from Pathanamthitta, Perunthenaruvi Waterfall is a wonderful waterfall situated at Vechoochira village in Kerala. It is one of the famous Pathanamthitta sightseeing places, and among the major waterfalls near Trivandrum.

                Situated in the forest region of Sabarimala, Perunthenaruvi allures tourists with its breathtakingly beautiful waterfalls and the dazzling stream that flows to merge with the sacred Pamba River. The locality is the home field of beehives which have bestowed the place with the title Perunthenaruvi meaning 'The Honey Stream'.
                
                There are two waterfalls at Perunthenaruvi - the 300 feet Panamkudantha and the 200 feet Padivathil - both of these originate from the dense woods of Sabarimala. The stream gushes further beyond through the rocky bed to unite with the holy Pamba. This is a wonderful place to spend few hours swimming and playing in the water and enjoying the spectacular views.</p>

            </h5>
              <p class="card-text">At a distance of 10 km from Pathanamthitta, Konni Elephant Training Center is located near Iravan village between Pathanamthitta and Pathanapuram. It is one of the most prominent elephant training centers in Kerala and among the major tourist places in Pathanamthitta.

                Located in a thick forest environment, this training center was used to train wild elephants. The big wooden cages used to put newly brought wild elephants for training are still an attraction. Locally known as Aanakoodu, they can house up to 3 to 4 elephants at a time.
                
                The primary focus of the trainers here is to deal with the development of baby elephants that have been separated from their herd or been found hurt somewhere. The elephants are taught to obey specific commands and are taken for special exercise walks in the morning, are given baths and specific diets. At Konni, one gets to observe this training procedure in person. The baby elephants love playing with the guests and are especially friendly with children. Bigger elephants are used for rides around the place.</p>
